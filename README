# Overview

In this project I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. 
My app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. 
This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
The times are calculated based on current time.

# Setup 

I used Firebase to store data, GitHub to backup your project, and GithHub Pages to host your finished site.
